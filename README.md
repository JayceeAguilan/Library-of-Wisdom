## 🎯 Project Objective

Collaboratively build a shared digital encyclopedia while mastering Git workflows including feature branches, pull requests, code reviews, and merge conflict resolution.

## 📁 Project Structure

```
Library-of-Wisdom/
├── README.md
├── CONTRIBUTING.md
├── data/
│   └── entries.json
├── history.md
└── script.js
```

## 🚫 Golden Rule

**NO DIRECT PUSHES TO `main` BRANCH**

All changes must come through Pull Requests (PRs). This applies to everyone, including the Lead.

## 👥 Team Members & Roles

| Member | Name | Role | Task |
|--------|------|------|------|
| Lead | Aguilan, John Christopher A. | Repository Owner | Setup & Oversight |
| Member 1 | Aguilan, John Christopher A. | **The Navigator** | Create CONTRIBUTING.md |
| Member 2 | Alico Cyreen G. | **The Historian** | Create history.md with Git facts |
| Member 3 | Aguilar, Justin Mikael | **The Stylist** | Update README with header & TOC |
| Member 4 | Abalos, Keith Lawrenz | **The Coder** | Create script.js |
| Member 5 | [Name] | **The Editor** | Add Mission Statement to README |

## 📚 Activity Phases

### Phase 1: The Setup ✅
- Repository created with initial scaffold
- Collaborators added
- Branch protection rules enabled

### Phase 2: Distributed Development 🚧
Each member works on their assigned feature in a separate branch:
- Branch naming: `feature/<your-name>`
- Work independently and simultaneously
- Commit changes with descriptive messages

### Phase 3: The Integration 🔄
- Submit Pull Requests for review
- Team members review and comment on PRs
- Merge approved changes
- **Merge Conflict Challenge:** Member 3 and Member 5 will encounter conflicts on README.md
- Resolve conflicts manually and merge successfully

### Phase 4: Assessment ✅
Evaluation criteria:
- ✓ Proper branching (no direct commits to main)
- ✓ Descriptive commit messages
- ✓ Clear PR descriptions and etiquette
- ✓ Successful conflict resolution without data loss
